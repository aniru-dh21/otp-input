# OTP Input in Vue 3

OTP inputs are one of the most fun components you can use in your app. They make the dry process of filling in yet another form a little more engaging.

## What's an OTP Input ?

An OTP input is a form component form component for strings. Each character in the string is typed into a separate box, and the component switches between boxes as you type (as opposed to you needing to click into each box).

It's called an OTP input because they're usually used to let users type in an OTP (One Time Password) that they've received via some other channel, usually email or SMS.
